## Acknowledgments

* Shout out to stack overflow always providing me with code for fragments & sensors (even tho i wasn't able to get the sensor to work before the deadline...)
* Shout out to the GSIs for holding office hours and emulator parties even tho my emulators never ended up working together :(
* Shout out to T-Mobile for providing me with an android phone on the quickness even tho I had to sign up for a plan to get the phone for cheaper since an unlocked phone with no plan is hella expensive
